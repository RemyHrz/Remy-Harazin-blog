| General topic?               | Dietary restriction increase the lifespan of a worm                                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | A dietary restriction was imposed to nematode worms (*C. elegans*). Researchers used bioinformatics to compare the regulation of genes in dietary restricted worms normal fed worms                      |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The dietary restriction caused a change in the regulation of genes of worms that increased their lifespan. The mechanism of aging isn't limited to genes themself but also by the way they're reagulated |
| Remaining questions?         |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
