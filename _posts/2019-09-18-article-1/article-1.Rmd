I started to improve my English by myself more than 3 years ago.
It started when I changed the language of a game I played (League of Legends) to English.
Then I played all of my games in English, and I set my phone in English as well.
In the beginning of the academic year, I set my computer language to English too.

When I watch something like tv shows, animes, videos, I try to watch them in English with English subtitles if it's possible.
For example, these days, I'm watching Rick and Morty on Netflix, in English with English subtitles.
I'm also watching seasonal animes in japanese, but with english subtiles.
