I started to improve my English by myself more than 3 years ago.
It started when I changed the language of a game I played (League of Legends) to English.
Then I played most of my games in English, and I set my phone in English as well.
In the beginning of the academic year, I set my computer language to English too.

When I watch something like tv shows, animes, videos, I try to watch them in English with English subtitles if it's possible.
For example, these days, I'm watching Rick and Morty on Netflix, in English with English subtitles.
I'm also watching seasonal animes in japanese, but with english subtiles.

05/11/19 I watched the second season of the netflix serie "The end of the F***ing world", it's in english (UK) with english subtitles

24/12/19 I watch Homeland on netflix, it's a tv show about counter-terrorism in USA
