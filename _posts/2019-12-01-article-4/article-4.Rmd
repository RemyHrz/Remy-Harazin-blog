| General topic?               | Disruption of a gene shows a decrease in metabolic pathways and cellular growth                                                                                                          |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The gene SHMT2 (serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2), genetically modified mouse embryo with an impaired version of SHMT 2, proteins separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The gene SHMT2 is needed for proper function of the mitochondria and division of the cell                                                                                                |
